Last [Tuesday, citizens of [Rosemania [witnessed the attack of a giant mass of [Zypitian ogres. They [landed atop the [spherical [Kae plaza and [began their rampage upon the Roman [district. The [attack was quickly counter by the defences of the Neptuian Authoritarian Brigade, led by captain Xavier Mirelles. These [ogres were roughly a quart in [volume linking together into [new complex destructive shapes that were recently theorized by [xenogeometrisist [Cray Po. In the aftermath of the attack the destruction was [estimated to be in the realm of 16,000 Olindrabucks. In a statment to the public, Archbishop of [Justice Speedleth [Pertopentine stated: "This has been a grave [misunderstanding and a poor [first contact with a future ally. It is our hope that [in the next days the [Yukon congress can [unionize the ogres and create a [quinticential future that Rosemania and the greater [Hulkan empire is [growing towards."
